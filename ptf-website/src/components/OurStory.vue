    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
            In February 2021, Pens to Friends was born in little town in Arizona, by a group of 
        high schoolers who wanted to make the world a little brighter. One of our founders 
        grew up hearing stories of her parent’s struggles in foster care. We wanted to do 
        something that combined our passion for art and desire to create positive change. 
        Quickly, we grew from an organization that connected with a couple of kids to one 
        that’s managed to spread light all around the world. We realize that even the smallest 
        of things can make a day brighter— a piece of art, a heartfelt story, or even just a few 
        kinds words. At Pens to Friends, our goal is to band the world together. <br>
