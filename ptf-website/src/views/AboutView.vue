    <h1>Our Mission:</h1>

    <p>
  We have all heard the stories before. The terrible experiences that children in foster care must observe, 
the lack of a strengthened and supporting foundation, the constant back and forth, unable to ever settle, 
or feel like they were important. When one of our founders heard a story like this from none other than her own 
parent, she was determined to make a change, whether it be big or small.
<br>
  In February of 2021, Pens to Friends was born. Its goal started out as a determined desire to better the 
  experiences of children in unfortunate situations, even if it's only just to put a smile on their faces.
<br>
  With new people coming in and sharing their stories, Pens to Friends has now expanded to spreading light all over the community. The smallest of things can make a day brighter, whether it be a piece of art, a heartfelt story, or even just a few kind words.
Here at Pens to Friends, our goal is to band the world together. One letter at a time.
